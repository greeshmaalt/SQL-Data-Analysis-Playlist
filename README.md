# Music Playlist Database Project

This project showcases my SQL data mining skills using Udacity's Chinook playlist database. Through this project, I provide elegant solutions to four foundational queries, highlighting my ability to extract valuable insights from complex datasets. To understand the relationships between the tables, you can refer to the database's Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD).
